# Paper LMS

**A Canvas-compatible learning management system for K-12 schools — single Go binary, modern React UI, no per-seat fees.**

Paper LMS speaks the Canvas REST API and ingests Canvas/IMSCC content packages, so districts can migrate without breaking their LTI tools, SIS integrations, or teacher workflows. Designed for K-12 from the ground up: K-2 picture-cue mode, parent observer accounts, FERPA/COPPA-aware models, OneRoster sync, and offline-friendly PWA.

> **Status:** Production-ready core. 84 domain models, 360 API routes, 67 frontend pages. Deployed and battle-tested across phases P0–P5. See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

**Migrate from Canvas in an afternoon:** point your Canvas API clients at Paper LMS, run `POST /api/v1/courses/:id/content_migrations` with your `.imscc` export, and you're live.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kocherm/paper-lms.git
cd paper-lms
cp .env.example .env   # edit JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, etc.
docker compose -f deployments/docker/docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>. The setup wizard creates your admin account on first run.

### Local development

```bash
# Backend (hot reload on save)
make build && ./paper-lms

# Frontend (Vite HMR on :5174)
cd web && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npm run dev

# Apply database migrations
make migrate-up
```

Requires Go 1.25, Node 20+, PostgreSQL 14+ (with the optional `pgvector` extension for Smart Search).

## Features

### Core LMS
- **Courses, modules, assignments, quizzes, discussions, pages, files** — full Canvas-equivalent CRUD with the same workflow states (`active`, `unpublished`, `deleted`).
- **Gradebook** with virtualized scrolling, custom columns, late policies, mastery paths, conditional release, learning outcomes, and bulk operations (set default / curve / message students).
- **SpeedGrader** for one-by-one submission grading with rubrics, audio/video feedback, and originality reports.
- **Rich Content Editor** (TipTap-based) with KaTeX math, embedded media, autosave drafts, and AI assist (outline / summarize / rewrite via Anthropic Claude).

### K-12 differentiators
- **Course UI modes**: K-2 picture-cue layout with read-aloud, 3-5 simplified, 6-12 standard.
- **Parent / observer accounts** with pairing codes, multi-child switcher, weekly digest emails.
- **Reading preferences**: dyslexia-friendly fonts (Lexend, OpenDyslexic), spacing controls, italic-stripping, TTS toggle.
- **Mobile-first PWA** with offline support and a 5-item bottom nav optimized for thumb reach.

### Enterprise & integrations
- **Auth**: JWT cookies, OAuth 2.0, Personal Access Tokens, SAML 2.0, LDAP, CAS 2.0.
- **SIS**: OneRoster v1.2 CSV sync, Canvas SIS Imports CSV format, ad-hoc enrollment APIs.
- **LTI 1.3** + LTI Advantage (Names & Roles, Deep Linking, Assignment & Grade Services).
- **IMSCC** import/export (Common Cartridge 1.3) for content migration in/out of Canvas, Schoology, Moodle.
- **Storage**: pluggable backends — local disk, S3, MinIO, Cloudflare R2.
- **Email**: SMTP with weekly digests; per-user notification preferences.

### Recently shipped (Phase 5 Wave 1)
- **Discussion checkpoints** — multi-deadline thread participation ("post by Tue, reply twice by Fri").
- **Smart Search** — pgvector-backed semantic search across announcements, assignments, pages, and discussions.
- **Commons content library** — district-wide template sharing with favorites and one-click import.
- **AI Assist** in the rich content editor — Claude Haiku 4.5 powers Outline / Summarize / Rewrite, gated by per-user rate limit.
- **Real RTL** — `tailwindcss-logical` plugin enabled, top-20 components migrated to logical properties.

## Configuration

The full env var list lives in [`.env.example`](./.env.example). A few highlights:

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | _(required in prod)_ | Auto-generated in dev; must be set for production. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `postgres://localhost/paper_lms` | Standard libpq DSN. |
| `AUTO_MIGRATE` | `true` | GORM AutoMigrate (dev). Set `false` in prod and use `make migrate-up`. |
| `STORAGE_BACKEND` | `local` | `local` or `s3`. |
| `S3_BUCKET`, `S3_ENDPOINT` | | For S3, MinIO, or R2. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | | Enables AI Assist features. Without it, AI returns 503 cleanly. |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | | Required in production for CORS. |
| `SMTP_HOST` | | SMTP for digests and notifications. |

---

## Deployment

Production deployment is a single Go binary plus a built React bundle, fronted by nginx. The provided `docker-compose.prod.yml` wires up Postgres, the backend, and an nginx reverse proxy with sane TLS-ready defaults.

For Kubernetes, ECS, or systemd deployment notes, see [`docs/deployment/`](./docs/deployment/).

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. Before opening a PR:

1. `go test ./...` and `cd web && npm run build` must pass.
2. Run `make vet` for static analysis.
3. New repositories follow the local-interface pattern (see [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) — *Recipe: New API Endpoint*).
4. New routes use Canvas-style error format `{"errors":[{"message":"..."}]}` and Link-header pagination (RFC 5988).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full workflow.
